# Meta Ads Master Agent - Deployment Summary

## ✅ Deployment Complete!

The consolidated Meta Ads Master Agent has been successfully deployed to your VPS with a multi-agent microservices architecture.

---

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. **Consolidated All Agents**
Merged 5 separate Meta Ads agents into one unified system:
- ✅ Unified Meta Ads Agent
- ✅ Master Meta Ads Agent
- ✅ Meta Ads Image Generator
- ✅ Meta Ads Veo 3.1 Generator
- ✅ Micro-Budget Meta Ads Agent

All old agents have been:
- Stopped and disabled (systemd services)
- Archived to `/root/old-meta-ads-agents-backup/`
- Replaced with the new master agent

### 2. **Microservices Architecture**
Created 4 independent microservices:

| Service | Port | Status | Purpose |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| **Master Orchestrator** | 8000 | ✅ Running | Coordinates all services |
| **Image Generator** | 8001 | ✅ Running | Generates ad images (Kie.ai Nano Banana) |
| **Performance Analyzer** | 8003 | ✅ Running | Tracks performance & selects hooks |
| **Campaign Manager** | 8004 | ✅ Running | Creates Meta Ads campaigns |

### 3. **Dockerized Everything**
- All services running in Docker containers
- Managed via docker-compose
- Auto-restart on failure
- Shared network for inter-service communication
- Persistent data volume for SQLite database

### 4. **GitHub Integration**
- Repository: https://github.com/mikee-ai/meta-ads-master-agent
- Auto-sync every 5 minutes via cron
- Git as source of truth
- Easy version control and rollback

### 5. **Automated Execution**
- Systemd timer runs every 15 minutes
- Creates 1 ad per execution
- $5/day budget per ad set
- Automatic hook testing with exploration/exploitation strategy

---

## 📊 Service Status

All services are healthy and running:

```json
{
  "master-orchestrator": "healthy",
  "image-generator": "healthy",
  "performance-analyzer": "healthy",
  "campaign-manager": "healthy"
}
```

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Execution Flow

1. **Timer Trigger** (every 15 minutes)
   - Systemd timer calls Master Orchestrator

2. **Hook Selection** (Performance Analyzer)
   - Analyzes past performance
   - Selects hook using 70/30 exploration/exploitation

3. **Image Generation** (Image Generator)
   - Generates scroll-stopping image with Kie.ai Nano Banana
   - MrBeast-style design with gradients
   - 9:16 aspect ratio for mobile
   - Cost: $0.02 per image

4. **Campaign Creation** (Campaign Manager)
   - Creates Meta Ads campaign
   - Sets up ad set with targeting (13 custom audiences)
   - Uploads creative
   - Creates ad with $5/day budget

5. **Performance Tracking** (Performance Analyzer)
   - Saves creative to database
   - Tracks metrics over time
   - Learns which hooks perform best

---

## 🎯 Hook Variations Being Tested

1. **Time_Savings** - "Stop Wasting 10+ Hours Per Week On Meta Ads"
2. **Cost_Savings** - "Cut Your Meta Ads Costs By 93%"
3. **FOMO_Social** - "10,000+ Marketers Already Using This Free AI"
4. **Money_Explosion** - "Replace Your $15K/Month Ads Team With AI"

---

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

**Per Ad:**
- Image generation: $0.02 (Kie.ai Nano Banana)
- Ad spend: $5/day (configurable)

**Daily (96 executions at 15-min intervals):**
- Images: 96 × $0.02 = $1.92/day
- Ad spend: Variable based on ad performance
